## üß™ Manual & Community-Contributed Sources

These are IOCs contributed by trusted analysts or manually extracted from:
- Threat research blogs and PDF reports
- Security conferences or dark web monitoring insights
- Internal SOC investigations (anonymized/sanitized)
- OSINT posts from verified CTI researchers on Twitter/X, GitHub, etc.

We **also include medium-confidence IOCs**, especially when tied to emerging threats or region-specific campaigns.

## üõ°Ô∏è Feed Selection Criteria

We select and verify feeds based on:

- Source credibility and history
- Frequency and recency of updates
- Confidence level of IOCs (we label them accordingly)
- Context provided (malware name, campaign, TTP, etc.)

  - Wildcard domains (e.g., `*.example.com`)
  - Cloud service providers (e.g., `*.google.com`, `*.microsoft.com`)
  - Content delivery networks (CDNs)
- All entries are normalized and deduplicated during ingestion
